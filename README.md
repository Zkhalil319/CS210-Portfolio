CS 250 Portfolio Submission: Sprint Review & Retrospective
Reflection Questions
1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs, I start by gathering requirements through methods like interviews, surveys, or direct feedback. User stories help by breaking down features into small, manageable tasks from the user’s perspective (e.g., "As a student, I want to submit assignments online so I can meet deadlines"). This keeps development focused on real user needs rather than assumptions.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I follow an iterative, Agile approach—building software in small increments and refining based on feedback. In the future, I want to use Scrum practices like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to improve teamwork and adaptability. Continuous integration (CI) and test-driven development (TDD) are also processes I’d like to adopt.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member:

Communicates clearly (updates progress, asks for help).

Collaborates (reviews peers’ code, pairs on tough problems).

Respects deadlines (breaks tasks into subtasks, avoids blockers).

Adapts to feedback (uses retrospectives to improve).
