# CS 250 Portfolio Submission: Sprint Review & Retrospective

## Reflection Questions

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?  
To interpret user needs, I gather requirements through interviews, surveys, or feedback. User stories (e.g., "As a student, I want to submit assignments online to meet deadlines") break features into manageable tasks from the user’s perspective, ensuring alignment with their needs.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate?  
I use iterative Agile development (e.g., Scrum). In the future, I’ll adopt sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to improve teamwork and adaptability.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  
- Communicate clearly (share progress, ask for help).  
- Collaborate (review peers’ code, pair on challenges).  
- Respect deadlines (break tasks into subtasks).  
- Adapt to feedback (use retrospectives to improve).
